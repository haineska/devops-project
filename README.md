# DevOps Project: Building a Microservices-Based Application with CI/CD and Monitoring
# This project involves deploying a microservices-based application using Jenkins for continuous integration, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and AWS for deployment. The application will include automation scripting in Python or JavaScript, use the .NET or TensorFlow framework, and expose APIs via AWS API Gateway. Monitoring will be implemented using CloudWatch, Prometheus.
# 
# Objective
# Create a microservices-based application with RESTful and SOAP APIs.
# Implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.
# Automate deployment with Kubernetes on AWS (using the Free Tier).
# Monitor application performance using CloudWatch and Prometheus.
# Project Structure
# Application: A web app using .NET or TensorFlow, containerized with Docker.
# Infrastructure: Provisioned with Kubernetes (EKS on AWS).
# CI/CD: Jenkins automates testing, building, and deployment.
# Monitoring: CloudWatch for logs and alarms.
